Parchment is a lightweight, structured logging library designed to persist log context throughout the lifecycle of a request or process. Inspired by the historical practice of recording events on parchment, Parch ensures that logs remain structured, contextual, and seamlessly available across function callsâ€”without requiring developers to manually pass loggers around.

# Create a new logger using your context
```go
log := parchment.New(context.Background())
```

# Add values to logger
```go
ctx = AddToLogger(ctx, []LoggerField{
		{Key: "first_key", Value: "first_value"},
	})
```

# Get logger from context
```go
log := parchment.FromContext(ctx)
```
